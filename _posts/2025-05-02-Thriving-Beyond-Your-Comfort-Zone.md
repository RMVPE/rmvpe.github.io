In the fast-paced world of engineering and technology, continuously challenging oneself is not just a choice but a necessity. Continuous and iterative practice of your principles makes risk-taking natural, builds character, and sets you apart from others. Exposing oneself to challenging situations, riddled with adversity, builds identity and garners influence amongst peers.

Consider the squirrel foraging for food at the edge of a brittle branch. This small creature engages in a cost-benefit analysis where the benefit of acquiring food comes at the risk of falling. Similarly, we too must understand the significance of practice taking risk.

Key is deliberate practice with calculated risk.

**Why is this important?**
Simple! By willingly exposing yourself to challenging situations, you become more accustomed to the rigors associated with difficult environments. This adaptation allows you to pilot through the chaos of a high-intensity work setting while continually producing high-quality work.

**Can you control how you expose yourself to challenging situations?**
Absolutely! However, only you can judge the boundaries of your comfort zone and determine how to methodically push beyond them. You must constantly expand your limits at whatever rate you can sustain, much like how the Magnificent Seven companies innovate to meet and exceed their customers’ expectations quarter over quarter, month over month.

**Embracing Longevity, Disruption, and Learning from Failures**

* **Staying for Longevity**: Remaining with a company or organization for an extended period allows you to deeply understand its culture, systems, and people. This stability can provide a strong foundation for personal and professional growth, enabling you to master your craft and build lasting relationships.

* **Stepping Out for Disruption**: Sometimes, the greatest growth comes from taking the leap into a new environment. Moving to a different company or organization can push you out of your comfort zone, forcing you to adapt, learn, and innovate. This disruption can be the catalyst for significant personal and professional development.

* **Learning from Failures**: Failures in one organization are not setbacks but stepping stones to success. Each failure teaches invaluable lessons, shaping your future by building resilience and refining your approach. You never know, but your strongest leadership story might come from your worst failure. By embracing and analyzing your failures, you not only grow but also set a foundation for your best future in another organization.

Strategies for Improving Your Ability to Face High-Risk Situations
* **Observe Risk-Takers**: Watch how others handle challenging situations while minimizing comparisons between yourself and them.
* **Know Yourself**: Deeply understand your identity, aspirations, and how you respond to adversity.
* **Develop Your North Star**: Establish a guiding light that helps you navigate through high-risk scenarios, allowing you to stay focused and resilient.

**A Good Read**
For those interested in understanding how to navigate change and the discomfort it brings, I highly recommend reading **“Who Moved My Cheese?”** by Spencer Johnson. This insightful book offers valuable lessons on adapting to change, embracing uncertainty, and thriving in dynamic environments.

In conclusion, deliberately pushing yourself out of your comfort zone is not just about personal growth — it’s about consistently delivering excellence in your professional life. As you embrace and manage risks, you will develop the resilience and skills necessary to thrive in the ever-evolving landscape be it engineering or technology.
