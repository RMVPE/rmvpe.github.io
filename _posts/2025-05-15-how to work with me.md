## How to Work with Me
*No one can aﬀord to make all the mistakes themselves*- we have to learn from others. That idea stuck with me the
first time I heard it. In engineering or any fast-moving field, every decision matters, and learning the hard way isn’t
always an option. Instead, we build on what’s been done, learn from past mistakes—ours and others—and use
those insights to work smarter. We bring in diverse perspectives, collaborate deeply, and let data guide us. That’s
how we make a real impact.

I believe leadership is about trust, collaboration, and continuous learning. We’re not just writing code or solving
problems; we’re building something bigger. Think of it like constructing a cathedral—you don’t lay bricks just for
the sake of it; you’re shaping something transformative. My goal is to help us all see that bigger picture, to create
an environment where great ideas thrive, and to move fast without breaking what matters.
Let’s talk about how we can work together.

## How I lead
I’m a servant leader at heart, which means I’m here to clear roadblocks, amplify strengths, and create space for
innovation. I don’t believe in top-down micromanagement—teams perform best when they’re trusted to make
decisions and move quickly, backed by data and customer insights.
The 3S Framework - Seek, Stitch, Share - My leadership approach is guided by the 3S Framework, helping teams
thrive in complex environments through curiosity, strategic thinking, and eﬀective communication.
* **Seek** - Ask questions, challenge assumptions, and dig deep before making decisions.
* **Stitch** – Connect the dots to keep a clear, strategic path that drives results.
* **Share**  – Keep communication open and transparent so we’re all on the same page.

## What I Value in a Team
I’ve been in Healthcare soWware engineering for 25+ years, and I’ve learned that great teams share a few common
traits.
* **Communication** - Words Matters : Clear and open communication is everything. I’d rather hear early concerns
than late surprises. If something’s unclear—ask. If you see a risk—raise it. If you have a better idea—share it.
* **Collaboration** - Break the Silos : The best solutions come when teams build on each other’s strengths, share
knowledge, and challenge ideas. I want us to:
* **Reuse, reduce, and eliminate waste** – Eﬃciency matters. Rework is costly—let’s share what we know
and avoid reinventing the wheel.
* **Break down the walls** – Whether it’s between teams, functions, or disciplines, if a barrier is slowing us
down, let’s remove it. Collaboration thrives when we work together, not in isolated pockets and silos.
 * **Challenge the Status Quo - What Got Us Here Won’t Get Us There**: If we always do things the way we’ve done them, we’re already behind. Growth happens when we step outside our comfort zones, and if something feels challenging, we’re probably on the right track. As **"Who Moved My Cheese?"** reminds us, change is inevitable—the sooner we adapt, the better we navigate uncertainty. Remember that we’re here to
build the future, not just maintain the present.

   * **Think Critically** – Just because something works doesn’t mean it’s the best way. Let’s keep questioning,
keep pushing.
   * **Be Bold, Humorous, and Caring** (paraphrasing from my Stanford LEAD program) – Innovation thrives where teams feel supported, connected, and free to take risks. Playing it too safe can be the biggest risk of all.
   * **Evolve continuously** – The tech world moves fast; we need to adapt or get leW behind.
  Take smart risks – Experiment, prototype, iterate fast. **#FailFast #LearnForward**
 * **Build a Strong Team Culture**  : I believe in building trust, fostering healthy conflict, and creating a cohesive
team where everyone feels safe to contribute. And as Brené Brown writes in **"Dare to Lead"**, vulnerability is a
strength—I encourage my team to take risks, share ideas, and learn from failures, because that’s where real growth happens. Culture is not who we are, but what we do together as a team, Daniel Coyle’s **"The Culture Code"** taught me that. For me, it’s about creating an environment where trust, shared purpose, and psychological safety thrive.

## Working with Me Day-to-Day
I like to keep things simple and straighjorward. Here’s how we can stay connected and make the most of our time
together:
* **Need a quick response?** Teams or Slack whatever is our org chat tool is your best bet.
* **Something urgent?** Call me anytime—I’m here for you.
* **General communication?** I follow a zero-inbox approach, so I’ll respond quickly.
* **Collaboration sessions?** My calendar is always up to date. A clear agenda and follow-ups help us make the most of our time. I love note taking!

To keep my day organized, I think in three layers: Windshield – What’s right in front of us; Landscape – What’s
coming up next? and Horizon – Where are we heading long-term? Along the way, I’ve learned to trust my instincts.
If something doesn’t feel right, it’s worth taking a closer look.

## A Little Bit About Me
I’ve spent my career building & leading high-performing teams, solving complex problems, and using technology to
make a real impact. With ti6 patents, I have carried a deep passion for innovation—finding new ways to solve
challenges and push the boundaries of what’s possible. My background is in Healthcare IT, which gives me a deep
appreciation for what we do in engineering R&D.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about traveling, cooking, and immersing myself in new cultures. I’ve also been
playing professional league cricket in Kansas City since 2005 with my team, the KC Chargers. For me playing Cricket
isn’t just a hobby—it’s how I stay active, competitive, and connected.

At home in Kansas City, life revolves around my wife, two kids, and our fur baby. 

Let’s Build, Innovate, and Lead Together

I’m excited about what we can accomplish. Let’s work together, push boundaries, and build something that truly makes a diﬀerence. Looking forward to the journey!
